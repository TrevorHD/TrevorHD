## About

As a researcher with more than 6 years of experience in data analysis, data visualisation, model building, and statistical programming, I have a wide variety of interests at the intersection of statistics, data science, and natural sciences. My current work in ecological systems is focused on plant dispersal and seeks answers to questions regarding (a) modelling dispersal processes, (b) the probabilistic nature of dispersal, (c) relative contributions of multiple dispersal vectors in series and parallel, and (d) how current dispersal patterns may be affected by climate change. Dispersal and movement in ecological systems can be quite challenging to understand, and I use a variety of mechanistic and statistical models to help unravel the mysteries behind these processes. I am also interested in applications of machine learning to problems of classification and prediction, especially in the realms of science, engineering, medicine, and business.

## Languages and Tools

I regularly work in R and have more than 6 years of experience in it, with about 2 years of experience in Python as well. In addition to these languages, some of the other languages and tools I have worked with include:

* SQL
* SAS
* TeX
* Spark
* Tk/Tcl

I also have some experience with Java and CSS/HTML, but it has been quite a while since I have worked with them.

## Stats

Below are some of my usage stats here on GitHub, including commits, issues opened, and some of my most frequently used programming languages. The code used to create these stats cards can be found [here](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

## Projects

All of my public repositories are readily accessible here on GitHub. Private repositories are listed below and are not publicly accessible due to confidential or sensitive materials.

* **AppliedSML** (*R, TeX*): A collection of analyses and case studies across a variety of domains, focusing on applications of statistical and machine learning in R. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on applied data mining and statistical learning.
* **CCFraud** (*R, TeX*): A case study using statistical and machine learning to detect instances of credit card fraud, using data consisting of 284,807 transactions from European cardholders in the span of 2 days.
* **ClassificationAlgorithms** (*R*): An implementation of algorithms for classifying multi-class data via a) na√Øve Bayes classification and b) logistic regression via gradient descent.
* **CombinedDispersal** (*R*): An analysis focused on building a model to quantify serial dispersal events (primary dispersal via wind and secondary dispersal via insect) in an invasive thistle species. Field data and empirical approaches are used to inform mechanistic and statistical models of dispersal and movement.
* **FlowerHeightShifts** (*R*): An analysis of experimental results examining how increases in ambient temperature affect the distribution of flower heights in two invasive thistle species, as well as the resulting effects on dispersal estimates under a fluid dynamics model.
* **InsectSeedRemoval** (*R*): A survival analysis of data from an experiment examining the effects of increased growing temperatures and elaiosome presence/absence on seed removal by insects, namely ants.

Several of these repositories are current research that will eventually be made public upon publication.
