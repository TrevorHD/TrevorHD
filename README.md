## About

As a researcher with years of experience in data analysis, data visualisation, model building, and statistical programming, I have a wide variety of interests at the intersection of statistics, data science, engineering, business, and natural sciences. My current work is in ecological systems and focuses on plant dispersal, seeking answers to questions regarding (a) modelling dispersal processes, (b) the probabilistic nature of dispersal, (c) relative contributions of multiple dispersal vectors in series and parallel, and (d) how current dispersal patterns may be affected by climate change. Dispersal and movement in ecological systems can be quite challenging to understand, and I use a variety of mechanistic and statistical models to help unravel the mysteries behind these processes. I am also interested in applications of machine learning to problems of classification and prediction.

## Github Stats

Below are some of my usage stats here on GitHub, including commits, issues opened, and my most frequently used languages. The code used to create these stats cards can be found [here](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

## Projects

All of my public repositories are readily accessible here on GitHub, under the "Repositories" tab; my private repositories are listed below and are currently not publicly accessible.

* **AppliedSML** (*R, TeX*) - A collection of analyses and case studies across a variety of domains, focusing on applications of statistical and machine learning in R.
* **CCFraud** (*R, TeX*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to detect instances of credit card fraud, using data consisting of 284,807 transactions from European cardholders in the span of 2 days. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on applied data mining and statistical learning.
* **CCDefault** (*R*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to predict rates of credit card default, using financial and demographic data from cardholders in Taiwan. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on data mining.
* **ClassificationAlgorithms** (*R*) - An implementation of algorithms for classifying multi-class data via a) na√Øve Bayes classification and b) logistic regression via gradient descent.
* **CombinedDispersal** (*R*) - An analysis focused on building a model to quantify serial dispersal events (primary dispersal via wind and secondary dispersal via insect) in an invasive thistle species. Field data and empirical approaches are used to inform mechanistic and statistical models of dispersal and movement.
* **DamageExperiment** (*R*) - An analysis of how repeated mechanical damage affects the survival regrowth of invasive thistles, as well as whether or not increased growing temperatures play a role in these processes.
* **PLDispersal** (*R*) - An analysis of a multi-year experiment examining how increases in ambient temperature affect the growth, reproduction, and dispersal of a weedy perennial plantain.
* **ShoppingData** (*R*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to predict rates of online advertisement conversion, using browsing data from online shoppers. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on data mining.

Several of these repositories are current research that will eventually be made public upon publication; others will remain inaccessible for privacy purposes.
