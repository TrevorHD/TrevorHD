## About

Researcher and applied statistician interested in quantifying movement in ecological systems; my work focuses on plant dispersal and seeks answers to questions regarding (a) modelling dispersal processes, (b) the probabilistic nature of dispersal, (c) relative contributions of multiple dispersal vectors in series and parallel, and (d) how current dispersal patterns may be affected by climate change. I am also interested in applying stastical and machine learning to other fields as well, such as medicine and finance. Most of my programming projects, for both work and fun, can be found here on GitHub.

## Languages and Tools

Some of the tools and programming languages I regularly use include:
* Python
* SAS
