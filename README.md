## About

I currently work as a market analyst in the semiconductor industry and have years of experience in data analysis, machine learning, model and simulation development, and statistical programming. My interests are quite varied and span fields such as business, statistics, engineering, data science, and natural sciences, among others. 

Outside of my day-to-day work, I also conduct research in ecological systems, with a focus on plant dispersal. This research addresses questions regarding (a) modelling dispersal processes, (b) the probabilistic nature of dispersal, (c) relative contributions of multiple dispersal vectors in series and parallel, and (d) how current dispersal patterns may be affected by climate change. Dispersal and movement in ecological systems can be quite challenging to quantify, and I use a variety of mechanistic and statistical models to help improve our understanding of these processes.

## Github Stats

Below are some of my usage stats here on GitHub, including commits, issues opened, and my most frequently used languages. The code used to create these stats cards can be found [here](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

## Programming Languages

Listed below are my preferred languages and how I use them in my daily work, scientific research, and personal projects:

* **R** - My go-to language for any sort of statistical computing (especially for scientific research), and the one I have the most experience with. I also frequently use it for data prep, simulation, and machine learning as well.
* **Python** - My preferred language for machine learning applications, though I will also use it for data prep and simulation.
* **SQL** - Will often run through R and Python when needing to interface with databases or manage large data pulls.
* **SAS** - Will occasionally use for statistical computing, though I much prefer R since it is significantly more versatile.
* **TeX** - Will occasionally use for typesetting in documentation, articles, and scientific publications.

## Projects and Repositories

All of my public repositories are readily accessible here on GitHub, under the "Repositories" tab; my private repositories are listed below and are currently not publicly accessible.

* **AppliedSML** (*R, TeX*) - A collection of analyses and case studies across a variety of domains, focusing on applications of statistical and machine learning in R.
* **CCFraud** (*R, TeX*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to detect instances of credit card fraud, using data consisting of 284,807 transactions from European cardholders in the span of 2 days. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on applied data mining and statistical learning.
* **CCDefault** (*R*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to predict rates of credit card default, using financial and demographic data from cardholders in Taiwan. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on data mining.
* **ClassificationAlgorithms** (*R*) - An implementation of algorithms for classifying multi-class data via a) na√Øve Bayes classification and b) logistic regression via gradient descent.
* **CombinedDispersal** (*R*) - An analysis focused on building a model to quantify serial dispersal events (primary dispersal via wind and secondary dispersal via insect) in an invasive thistle species. Field data and empirical approaches are used to inform mechanistic and statistical models of dispersal and movement.
* **DamageExperiment** (*R*) - An analysis of how repeated mechanical damage affects the survival regrowth of invasive thistles, as well as whether or not increased growing temperatures play a role in these processes.
* **PLDispersal** (*R*) - An analysis of a multi-year experiment examining how increases in ambient temperature affect the growth, reproduction, and dispersal of a weedy perennial plantain.
* **ShoppingData** (*R*) - A collaborative case study using statistical and machine learning to predict rates of online advertisement conversion, using browsing data from online shoppers. These analyses were conducted as part of a course on data mining.

Several of these repositories are current research that will eventually be made public upon publication; others will remain inaccessible for privacy purposes.
